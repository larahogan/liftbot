?best bench
    your best bench: **65x5** on 12/1/2016

?1rm bench
    you don't have a 1rm saved yet!
    *or*
    your calculated 1rm based on your 12/1/2016 workout = **~75**

*For your upper body, find the heaviest weight you can lift 4-6 times and plug it into this equation: (4.6RM X 1.1307) + 0.6998. So if you can do 5 reps of 60kg, then according to the formula – (60 x 1.1307) + 0.6998 – your 1RM will be 68.5kg.*

*This calculator is based on the formula derived by Boyd Epley in 1985, which is 1RM = weight x (1 + (reps / 30))*
